        ## What is it ?

        This feature allows you to link multiple automations together using this blueprint.


        Small example:


        You, your wife or your son must complete a task. It doesn''t matter who does
        it. You each receive reminder notifications that you can individually snooze
        as usual.


        When one of you acknowledges the notification, all the others will receive
        a final notification that the task has been completed.
